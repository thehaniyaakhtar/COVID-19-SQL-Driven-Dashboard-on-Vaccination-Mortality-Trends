# 📊 COVID-19 Global Trends Analysis Using SQL & Tableau

This project explores COVID-19 data using **SQL** for in-depth analysis and **Tableau** for interactive visualization. Data was sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), covering global pandemic trends such as infection and death rates, vaccination rollouts, and country-wise comparisons.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Derive insights into COVID-19’s global impact using SQL and communicate findings through a Tableau dashboard.
- **Tools Used:**  
  - SQL (MySQL) for data transformation and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
  - Tableau for interactive dashboards and visual storytelling  
- **Dataset Source:**
  - [OurWorldInData COVID-19 Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

## 🛠️ Key SQL Operations

✔️ Created and populated two tables:  
`covid_cases` (case & death metrics) and `covid_data` (testing & vaccination metrics)

✔️ Conducted EDA with queries like:
- 🧮 Global and country-level infection and death rates
- 💉 Vaccination coverage over time using `WINDOW FUNCTIONS` and `CTEs`
- 📌 Top 10 countries by infection rate and total deaths
- 🌍 Continent-level comparison of COVID-19 outcomes
- 🔄 Created a dynamic **VIEW** and **TEMP TABLE** to analyze rolling vaccination trends

---

## 📈 Tableau Dashboard

Built an interactive dashboard that includes:
- Infection and death trends by country
- Vaccination progress over time
- Country-wise and continent-wise comparison charts
